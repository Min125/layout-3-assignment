    <string name="one_mission">One Piece, according to me will be sort of different from what the previous answers seem to suggest. Gold Roger could simply be called so to lull the rumors about the Will of D and the family of D. And he never mentions that his treasure was gold. Remember that Woonan had acquired a third of the worlds treasure and hidden it. No one is aiming for that treasure. They are all aiming for One Piece.The one piece is supposed to hidden on the island at the far end of the Grand line, which can be reached only after traversing through the New World (as far as pirates are concerned). But, the navy has already found a way to get there using the calm belt. So, it cannot be a massive weapon in itself. The navy would long since have taken possession of it had this been so.Now, it could be a weapon of mass destruction like Neptune or Pluto as mentioned before. But that is somewhat unlikely. What is likely is it be a method making the third weapon. Which I am assuming will be called Jupiter (Pluton, Neptune and Jupiter are brothers and sons of Saturn). It will most likely be a weapon which works on domination over destruction as Jupiter, and Haou, all point towards a dominating king over a destroying tyrant.So, I believe that the One Piece would be a sort of method to make Jupiter (Methods to make Pluto and Neptune have already been shown and gotten rid of, so this has to be it). Following the pattern of Pluto being a warship, then Neptune being a fish-princess, it is likely that One Piece would basically make the Pirate King (The one who found it) the literal King of the Seas. With an ability to control everyone in the seas. And to be able to attack every island easily from the seas. (Using abilities of Neptune and Pluton)This information could come as the link between all the Poneglyphs or as a single book showing the entire method.</string>
